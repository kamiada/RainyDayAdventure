But you managed to survive. Better even. Seeing the suffering of people who you cared about, made you realise that you really want to do one thing - become a doctor. But, that's not easy. Women are not allowed to study, especially at university. And you may finish accused of witchcraft. Still, you manage to help in the local hospital and one day the idea comes to your mind. That day, Lucia Fiori dies and new person, young man called Luca Specchio appears instead. So here you are. In male clothes, cut short hair and fake deep voice, working as an assistant to a famous doctor. You keep your head low, but life is good and you appreciate every day of your new life. Until today."

They seems to be scared, one of them pushes you brutally away and charge into a room, helping his comrade. The other man is hurt, something is wrong with him, and when they lay him on the kitchen table, you can see his pale face, wet from the rain and sweat hair and eyes moving rapidly behind the lids. Neither you or your master knows who those people are. One of them turn out to be a woman, clearly of noble birth, with soft hands and plead in her eyes. 'Help us', she begs the doctor. 'Our companion was wounded and now the wound is infected'."
